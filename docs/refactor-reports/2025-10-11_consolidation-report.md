## UNIFIED PLAN STRUCTURE

### Dashboard (at top)

**Summary Counts:**
- Done: 30 items (Dead Code: 2, SRP: 17, Rename: 3, Perf: 3, Docs: 5)
- Todo: 14 items (P0: 3, P1: 5, P2: 6)

**Metrics Summary:**
- God classes eliminated: 3 → 0 (-100%)
- Average function length: 18.2 → 6.4 lines (-65%)
- Functions >12 lines: 11 → 2 (-82%)
- Dead code eliminated: 248 lines

### What's Done (Sections)

1. **Phase 1: God Class Elimination** (7 items, D1-D7)
2. **Phase 2: Newspaper Layout + Micro-Functions** (7 items, D8-D14)
3. **Phase 3: Dead Code Elimination** (6 items, D15-D20)
4. **Focused: ArrayBucket Performance** (5 items, D21-D25)
5. **Phase 2 High Priority Implementation** (2 items, D26-D27)
6. **Dead Code Report Summary** (248 lines removed)

### Backlog (Prioritized Tables)

**P0 (High Priority):** 3 items
- T1: Extract RowProcessor abstraction

- **Sources:** Table mapping original → new paths
- **Git Evidence:** Canonical commit info, files changed, branch info
- **Appendices:** Naming convention, cross-links, build verification

---

## FILES MIGRATED

### Naming Convention Adopted

```
YYYY-MM-DD_refactor-<phase/module>-<topic>.md
```

**Rationale:**
- Date-first for chronological sorting
- Consistent "refactor-" prefix
- Descriptive phase/module and topic
- All lowercase with hyphens

### Migration Table

| Original File | New Path | Date | Size |
|---------------|----------|------|------|
| `refactoring-report-phase1.md` | `refactor-reports/2025-10-05_refactor-phase1-god-classes.md` | 2025-10-05 | 24 KB |
| `refactoring-report-phase2.md` | `refactor-reports/2025-10-05_refactor-phase2-newspaper-layout.md` | 2025-10-05 | 22 KB |
| `refactoring-report-phase3.md` | `refactor-reports/2025-10-06_refactor-phase3-dead-code.md` | 2025-10-06 | 22 KB |
| `refactoring-report-arraybucket-upsert.md` | `refactor-reports/2025-10-06_refactor-arraybucket-upsert.md` | 2025-10-06 | 31 KB |
| `refactoring-report-phase2-implementation.md` | `refactor-reports/2025-10-06_refactor-phase2-implementation.md` | 2025-10-06 | 19 KB |

**Total:** 5 files migrated, ~118 KB of documentation

## SUPERSEDED BANNERS ADDED

Each moved report now contains a banner at line 1:

```markdown
> **SUPERSEDED:** This report has been consolidated into [UNIFIED-REFACTORING-PLAN.md](../UNIFIED-REFACTORING-PLAN.md)

---
```

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `2025-10-05_refactor-phase1-god-classes.md`
- ✅ `2025-10-05_refactor-phase2-newspaper-layout.md`
- ✅ `2025-10-06_refactor-phase3-dead-code.md`
- ✅ `2025-10-06_refactor-arraybucket-upsert.md`
- ✅ `2025-10-06_refactor-phase2-implementation.md`

**Link Verification:** All relative links (`../UNIFIED-REFACTORING-PLAN.md`) are correct.

## DASHBOARD: DONE vs TODO

### Done Items (30)

|----------|-------|----------|
| **Dead Code** | 2 | PathUtil removal, ArrayBucket legacy path optimization |
| **SRP** | 17 | God class extractions, micro-function splits |
| **Rename** | 3 | Newspaper ordering, positive intent conditionals |
| **Test Migration** | 0 | N/A |
| **Perf** | 3 | ArrayBucket hot path, cache optimization |

## ISSUES / INCONSISTENCIES FOUND

### During Consolidation

1. **Duplicate Entries Merged:**
   - "Newspaper layout" appeared in Phase 2 (main) and Phase 3 (continuation)
   - **Resolution:** Merged as single item (D9) with references to both phases

2. **Inconsistent Naming:**
   - Original files: `refactoring-report-phase1.md`, `refactoring-report-arraybucket-upsert.md`
   - **Resolution:** Applied consistent YYYY-MM-DD prefix convention

3. **Phase 2 Split:**
   - Phase 2 had both a "plan" report and an "implementation" report
   - **Resolution:** Separated into D8-D14 (main phase) and D26-D27 (backlog implementation)

4. **Git Commit Discovery:**
   - All work in single commit "refactor wip" (1271b0b)
   - **Resolution:** Documented as canonical commit in unified plan

5. **PathOps.splitPath() Status:**
   - Initially flagged for removal in Phase 3
   - **Resolution:** Kept (used in flat2pojo-benchmarks, outside scope)

### No Issues With

- ✅ Build status (all reports show passing tests)
- ✅ Metric consistency (aggregate metrics align across reports)
- ✅ File paths (all absolute paths valid)
- ✅ Cross-references (no broken links in original reports)
